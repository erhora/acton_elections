I have a couple distinctions between the data in this folder:

- Jumbled about are my shapefiles and pdf downloads from the town of Acton, MA.

- r_processed: These are the semi-cleaned pdf downloads (going from a block of text to a tibble).

- data_for_tableau: The r_processed data were cleaned even further, and now they are ready for Tableau.
